The nominees were announced on Wednesday by Mike Fennell, chairman of the Selection Committee, at a press conference held at the TVJ studios. The five nominees for Sportswoman of the Year are Rushell Clayton, Jhaniele Fowler, Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, Shericka Jackson, and Danielle Williams, while the contenders for Sportsman of the Year are Tajay Gayle, Jaheel Hyde, Fraser McConnell, Hansle Parchment, and Wayne Pinnock. Shericka Jackson’s 21.41 clocking to win the women’s 200 metres, Shamar Nicholson’s opening goal against Canada, Drew Spence’s freekick against Canada, Antonio Watson’s 400-metre-gold-medal run at the 2023 World Athletics Championships, and Danielle Williams’ gold-medal-performance in the women’s 100-metre hurdles final were nominated for the People’s Choice Awards. The awards ceremony will be held at The Jamaica Pegasus hotel on January 19, 2024. Headlines Delivered to Your Inbox Sign up for The Gleaner’s morning and evening newsletters. Mike Fennell, chairman of the selection panel, pointed out that track and field dominated the nominations because the athletes were doing well on the world stage. Fennell added that other sporting bodies would have to use track and field as a marker and elevate themselves in order to achieve the recognition they deserve. “Track and field athletes are performing well at the world level, and you cannot deny that. In the past, look at the record, boxing used to dominate. Those sports need to look at themselves and bring themselves up to the same level as track and field,” said Fennell. Nine of the 11 athletes nominated were from the sport of track and field, with the other two, Jhaniele Fowler, coming from netball, and Fraser McConnell, from the sport of motor racing. Fennell added that the performances of Jamaica’s athletes have overshadowed some of the challenges in the country and praised Fraser McConnell’s nomination. “The performances of our athletes have overshadowed that and allowed us as a country to have a good image. Motorsport isn’t easy, but he has, through his own connections, provided himself with those resources, and it shows that we have the talent to do great things in many different sports, and what he’s done is phenomenal,” said Fennell. Gary Allen, chairman of the RJRGLEANER Sports Foundation, said it was of paramount importance that the performances of our leading sportsmen and women be highlighted. “We are powerhouses on the global stage in terms of the accomplishments that we have. So it’s very pleasing for us to highlight this,
recognise and call attention to the fact that we’re doing all of these outstanding things positively on the global stage,” said Allen. Allen also added that Jamaica should be proud of the accomplishments of the athletes, which he refers to as “pots of excellence”. “We need to pause in Jamaica and recognise that amidst all the other challenges we have to contend with, we really have these pots of excellence that we should be proud of.” orane.buchanan@gleanerjm.com","content":"THE NOMINEES for the 2023 RJRGLEANER Communications Group National Sportsman and Sportswoman of

The ban takes effect December 8. Cabinet members are instead encouraged to use French encrypted messaging app Olvid, which, unlike its global competitors, does not require a SIM card or phone number
from its users and encrypts metadata as well as message content. The French app, said to be more private and secure than those competitors, is the only messaging platform to be awarded a security certificate by the French National Agency for the Security of Information Systems (ANSSI). Another French messaging app, Tchap, is also permitted. The rule is similar to a policy adopted by the military of Switzerland, which ordered soldiers to stop using the three popular messaging
apps last year and instead to use Threema, a domestically-developed encrypted messaging service, for both official and private chats. Borne’s memo represents the second round of app bans for French public servants this year. In March, Minister of Public Services Stanislas Guerini announced that TikTok and similar “ ” were to be prohibited on government phones due to the security risks they posed. Twitter and Instagram were also banned, as were streaming video platform Netflix, the game Candy Crush, and dating apps. At the same time, the National Assembly urged MPs to “
” their use of TikTok, which has been banned from government phones in nearly a dozen countries
and the EU due to concerns about data security. Legislators were also encouraged to cut back on
their use of Instagram, Snapchat, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Signal. While WhatsApp offers theoretically encrypted messaging, the company, a subsidiary of Facebook’s parent company Meta, is known for readily handing over users’ data to the US government without even the suspicion that the user has committed a crime. A security flaw in the app also allowed Israeli spyware tool Pegasus
to be installed on the user’s phone without requiring any action from that user, who otherwise had to click a link to unwittingly turn their phone into a surveillance device. French President
Emmanuel Macron personally changed his phone and his number in 2021 after it was reported that he and 14 of his cabinet ministers had been targeted for surveillance by Morocco using Pegasus. In July, the French government adopted a law permitting law enforcement agencies to remotely access the cameras, microphones, and location services of devices belonging to individuals suspected of involvement in illegal activities for which the punishment is more than five years in prison, such as terrorism.

Franklin Witter, is commending the National Irrigation Commission (NIC) Limited for its invaluable contribution to agricultural productivity and food security in Jamaica. Mr. Witter, who was addressing the agency’s 36th anniversary luncheon and long service awards ceremony on November 28 at the Jamaica Pegasus Hotel in
New Kingston, said this significant milestone not only marks a journey of dedication and resilience, but also stands as a testament of the critical role of irrigation in the advancement of the agricultural sector. He said that consistent and reliable irrigation service is critical to safe and abundant food supply. “NIC is the standard bearer of the Ministry. It is heartening to see that the NIC operations are aligned seamlessly with the Ministry’s New FACE of Food initiative, which focuses on food security, agri-business, climate smart initiatives, and export expansion,” he noted. Mr. Witter pledged the Ministry’s continued support and investment in the agency in
the ongoing quest to safeguard the country’s food security. “We must harness the power of modern technology …the NIC must be at the forefront of innovation and research. We need to invest in cutting-edge technologies and methodologies that optimise our irrigation systems and optimise our agricultural production,” he said. Chief Executive Officer of the NIC, Joseph Gyles, in his remarks at the ceremony, said the NIC will be expanding its irrigation districts, increasing these
from 16 to 19. He noted that presently, the Commission produces over 60-million-cubic metres of
water on an annual basis. “As we navigate the future, we embrace automation and digitisation and have accepted that if we are to survive in this global world sustainability must remain at the
core of our operational ethos,” he said. The NIC is mandated to manage, operate, maintain and expand existing irrigation schemes and systems established by the Government of Jamica or by any department or agency, as well as to fix and collect the rates or charges for the use of such water systems. The NIC maintains an island-wide presence through six district offices located in key irrigation areas.","pubDate":"2023-11-29 18:42:28","image_url":null,"source_id":"jis","source_priority":68778,"country":["gabon"],"category":["top"],"language":"english"},{"article_id":"dca4b4be9da848220c9d5afd068424cc","title":"Air Force awards Boeing $2.3B contract for 15 more KC-46s","link":"https://zephyrnet.com/air-force-awards-boeing-2-3b-contract-for-15-more-kc-46s/","keywords":["Defense","10","12","153","179","2022","2027","23","24","35","46","75","a","A-10","abilities","ability","About","addition","Additional","aerial","aging","Air","Air Force","airbus","Aircraft","All","allies","also","among","an","and","and the","announced","another","around","around the world","AS","At","Award","awarded","Awards","base","Battlefield","BE","beyond","Billion","Boeing","brings","build","builds","But","buy","by","california","CAN","capabilities","Cargo","carry","centers","Certification","chances","COM","Command","Communications","communications systems","compete","complete","complex","contract","cover","covered","data","Defense News","delivered","distance","Due","duration","During","east","encryption","end","evacuation","evening","Event","Everett","Except","Exercise","expected","factory","Fall","FAR","Features","fighters","First","Five","FLEET","follows","For","Force","four","from","Fuller","furthest","Gateway","generation.","Ground","guardian","had","he","HOURS","hub","in","Including","increased","Indo","installations","interim","Is","Israel","issued","issues","IT","ITS","January","Japanese","Jersey","joint","jointly","July","KC-46","KC-46A Pegasus","largest","Leadership","Line","location","Lockheed","Lockheed Martin","logistics","Long","Long-Distance","lot","major","March","Martin","May","medical","Members","Middle","Middle East","Military","million","missions","mobility","more","Neptune","new","New Jersey","news","number","October","of","on","Operations","Ordered","Other","out","Own","Pacific","part","partnered","passengers","patients","Pegasus","Pentagon","Personnel","picture","pitch","planned","plans","plato","Plato Data Intelligence","PlatoData","presence","previously","Production","provide","received","Refueling","region","release","replace","reporter","ROSE","s","Said","scoring","SELF","Self-Defense","September","September 2022","Series","Service","Share","showed","Sight","So","so Far","special","Special Operations","States","Status","steadily","Stephen","still","straight","support","Systems","Tanker","tankers","Technologies","that","The","the world","their","These","this","those","times","to","took","transport","traveled","travis","Tuesday","two","U.S. Air Force","United","United States","up","Upgrade","valued","warfare","was","washington","Wave","week","West","When","Which?","will","with","Work","world","would","zephyrnet"],"creator":["Republished By Plato"],"video_url":null,"description":"WASHINGTON — The Air Force has awarded Boeing a $2.3 billion contract for 15 more KC-46A Pegasus refueling tankers.

The award, announced by the Pentagon Tuesday evening, brings to 153 the number of KC-46s Boeing has on contract to build for the United States and allies. The Air Force plans to buy 179 KC-46s, and Boeing said it has so far delivered 76 of those. The Japanese Air Self-Defense Force has two KC-46s in its fleet and four more on contract with Boeing, and Israel has ordered four of its own. The Pentagon said work on these aircraft, which will be the KC-46′s tenth production lot, is expected to be complete by the end of July 2027. Boeing builds KC-46s at its factory in Everett, Washington. This contract follows another issued in January for the ninth production lot , which was also for 15 tankers and valued at $2.3 billion. The Air Force has steadily increased the presence of the KC-46 in its fleet and its abilities. In September 2022, the service cleared the KC-46 to refuel all aircraft, except the A-10 Warthog, and carry out all refueling missions around the world. In July, Travis Air Force Base in California received its first of 24 planned KC-46s, which will replace the base’s aging KC-10 Extenders. Travis, the largest and furthest west of Air Mobility Command’s installations, is nicknamed the “Gateway to the Pacific” due to its location and status as a major hub for logistics and other mobility operations. KC-46s also took part in July’s Mobility Guardian 23 exercise in the Indo-Pacific region, during which the tankers flew sorties of up to 35 hours straight. The service said in a release this showed the aircraft’s ability to carry out complex long-distance, long-duration missions to refuel fighters and other aircraft during operations. And this fall, five KC-46s and about
12 service members from Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey took part in a force generation certification event during the two-week Neptune Series exercise at Travis. In addition to aerial refueling, the KC-46 can transport cargo, passengers and medical patients in aeromedical evacuation support missions, and can share data among other aircraft and ground operations centers to provide a fuller picture of the battlefield. The Air Force awarded Boeing a $184 million
contract in March to upgrade the KC-46′s communications systems with capabilities including antijamming and encryption features for its line-of-sight and beyond-line-of-sight communications technologies. The Air Force also may buy an additional wave of 75 KC-46s as part of its planned recapitalization of its KC-135 fleet. Boeing’s chances of scoring that contract rose in October, when Lockheed Martin announced it would not compete for the interim tanker. But Airbus, which had partnered with Lockheed to jointly pitch their LMXT tanker, said it still plans to compete to replace the KC-135s. Stephen Losey is the air warfare reporter for Defense News.

Wilson's return has been accompanied by the removal of four directors from the company's board — Arlene Martin, Ricardo Allen, Dainya-Joy Wint and Ivan Carter — along with the exit of Crichton Mullings & Associates as the company's auditors. This all
occurred at the company's annual general meeting (AGM) last Friday at the Jamaica Pegasus hotel. \"After careful reflection, I am honoured to announce my return to iCreate, resuming my role as a director after being voted in by an overwhelmingly majority of the shareholders present. I am also elated to return as CEO, pending the final decision of a board majority to reinstall me, along with any other roles they see fit. This decision is rooted in a profound commitment to the
company I founded,\" Wilson stated in release under Kintyre Holdings Limited which lists him as
its chairman and CEO. While this release infers that most shareholders voted in favour of Wilson's appointment, this was due to the mechanism in which he was put back into the company. Once per year, a company is required to hold an AGM with its shareholders where they vote on matters such as approving the audited financial statements, re-electing directors, confirming the remuneration of directors and the reappointment of external auditors. Under normal circumstances, each shareholder present has one vote on a show of hands which is the mechanism by which resolutions are carried or denied by shareholders. However, in this instance, Wilson requested that the voting be carried out by poll which means that each share represents a vote which means the more shares a person owns, the more votes that person has. While Wilson doesn't own any ordinary shares of iCreate in his name, he was appointed as the proxyholder or representative of Kyntire Holdings and Emedia Interactive Group Limited which collectively hold 52.4006 per cent of the company as of September 30 and were listed as connected parties to Wilson. Thus, whatever Kyntire and Emedia collectively voted for on the proxy form would be the result for any resolution regardless of what other shareholders present, whether in person or by proxy, voted in favour of. Even Sagicor Investments Jamaica Limited, the eighth largest shareholder, who voted in favour of all the resolutions was powerless to influence the decisions voted on. As a result, items which found favour with Wilson such as the company's 2022 financial statements and directors report, re-election of Larren Peart and Adrian Smith as directors and remuneration of directors were approved. Others which did not find favour were swept aside. These surprising developments threw the audience
into a state of shock, including company secretary Demetrie Adams, Chairman Carter and interim CEO Martin. The decision to vote down Ricardo Allen's re-election comes as a relative surprise since Wilson resigned from the board of One-on-One Educational Services Limited on August 21. Allen is the CEO of One-on-One, another Junior Market listed company. Following the quick recess, a
new legal quandary was created for secretary Adams who noted that the results of the resolutions impacted the company's own ability to carry out any decision since its articles required a minimum of three directors to constitute a functioning board. It also left the company without an external auditor which is required by JSE rules. Crichton produced a qualified audit report for iCreate's 2022 audited financials based on the absence of comprehensive and reliable documentation for assets held by its subsidiary and inability to carry out audit procedures to assess the impairment of the acquisition of shares. After reading through certain elements of the Companies Act and referencing iCreate's articles, Adams moved onto any other business segment of the meeting where Larren Peart proposed that Wilson be appointed as a director of the company. Wilson then
seconded the resolution with no one else indicating their expression through a show of hands as
many remained in angst at what they had just witnessed. While another shareholder proposed that
iCreate's tenth largest shareholder Dane Warren be appointed as a director to the board, Warren
declined the opportunity as he referenced his overseas commitments. Thus, at the end of the AGM, Wilson, Peart and Smith constituted iCreate's board in what was one of the most unexpected and
surprising board takeovers in recent times. Though Wilson remained elated while donning dark shades, a white ensemble and a Gucci bag at the end of the meeting, attendees remained in disbelief at what they had just witnessed with one iCreate Group employee expressing clarification at whether or not they should return to work based on the changes they just observed. Adams will be departing iCreate on December 31 after tendering his resignation. What's next for iCreate? Friday's developments have left several brokers and investors with financial exposure to iCreate perplexed as to what's next for the business under Wilson's direction. Both Sagicor Investments and Warren have reduced their positions in iCreate since December 2022. It's unknown as to how the JSE will treat with iCreate which was suspended for nearly two months for breaches of the Junior Market rules. There has been no update by the JSE or iCreate as to the director which sold shares
on August 16 when the company had not released its second quarter report or audited financial statements. The JSE Junior Market rules require for there to be at least two independent non-executive directors on the board of a company, an audit committee, a remuneration committee and produce audited financial statements within the stipulated framework. iCreate's 2022 annual report noted that Wilson and Smith were non-independent directors at the time. However, Smith is no longer associated with Dequity Capital Management Limited, which is iCreate's fourth largest shareholder and might make him an independent director. The removal of Allen, Carter and Wint has also left iCreate without an audit committee. Minority shareholders in iCreate can attempt to sell their position in the company if there are buyers on the market for the volume they are selling or
increase their position if they have a different belief. Another option is an oppression remedy
or derivative action under the Companies Act based on their interpretation of the current developments. Latest financial performance Although Wilson has ascended back to the throne of iCreate, the group is still attempting to chart its future in a difficult 2023. iCreate's nine-month revenue is down 21 per cent to $78.38 million with a net loss of $150.12 million. This loss is largely because of acquisition related expenses for Visual Vibe.com Limited which was acquired on May 31. The group's net cash balance is $5.54 million after it took out a recent $55.84 million loan during the third quarter to deal with their negative $28.63 million cash outflow from their operations. Although total assets are at $700 million, total liabilities continue to climb above
$375 million as iCreate racks up expenses related to the US$1.27 million vendor note for Visual
Vibe. iCreate's 100 per cent tax remission will end in February 2024 which will result in it being subject to a 50 per cent tax remission. iCreate recently entered into a letter of intent to sell 20 per cent of Visual Vibe in the fourth quarter to another party, which is rumoured to be a doctor. Its stock price is also down 66 per cent year to date to $0.60 with the market pricing
in Friday's developments. iCreate traded at a peak price of $4.90 in June 2022.","content":"Wilson's return has been accompanied by the removal of four directors from the company's board — Arlene Martin, Ricardo Allen, Dainya-Joy Wint and Ivan Carter — along with the exit of Crichton Mullings & Associates as the company's auditors.
